BindyStreet Take Home Interview -- This web application was created with create-react-app typsecript template and a .Net Web Api was also integrated into this application,

## Usage Instruction for running this repo locally

### Clone this repository
## `git clone https://github.com/DotmanL/BindyStreet-Task.git`
Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/DotmanL/BindyStreet-Task.git` into your desired directory.
cd into the cloned folder `cd BindyStreet-task` then cd into the ClientApp directory, using `cd ClientApp`

### Install all dependencies 
## `npm install`
While in the ClientApp directory, run `npm install` and wait for all dependencies to be installed.

# Switch back to the base directory ('BindyStreet-Task`)
This can be done by running `cd ..`

###  (Optional Step) Build the project without debugging
## `dotnet build`

### (Final Step), run the project, this serves the .NetWeb Api and React App together
## `dotnet run`
### This might take a while, some webpack deprecation warnings will show up, ignore this. Once you can see the deprecation warnings, the react web is live and can be accessed on https://localhost:5001/ in your browser, initial loading of the app might take a while to completely render.

## Enjoy the views in both Light and Dark Mode, 
## You can also view the demo static web app but with partial functionality as the .NetApi is not connected on the static demo site at https://bindystreet-task.netlify.app/
